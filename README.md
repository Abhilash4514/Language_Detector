# Language_Detector
In this project, building a translation model similar to Google Translate using Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotllib, Scikit learn and some Machine Learning concepts and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
Firstly, import the python library numpy and pandas and read the upload file through Pandas then all of the data are converted in the binary form then creat a machine learning model for train and test the data for converting the data into binary form I import the countVectorizer feature from sklearn library (sklearn.feature_extraction.text) then build machine learning model and import train_test_split from sklearn library (sklearn.model_selection) then I using naive bayes algorithm for using the word count MultinomialNB  and use the feature I upload the data file and move on data cleaning process. In this process, I check any null value is available or not in this file then check the data type we get it show object(string) so the data is converted in the form of array through numpy after using countVectorizer for transform the data in form of matrices. Now build the machine learning model that is divided into two form first is train and second is test after train check the accuracy of the model using with model.score()
